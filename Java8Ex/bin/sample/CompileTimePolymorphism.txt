Compile time polymorphism refers to overloading .
In overloading,  which method will be invoked
        is decided at compilation time only         
        Based on the method name and the parameters being passed.
        
   Compiler can decide which method is matching.
  
   That   is why overloading is known as compile time polymorphism.
   
   Also known as Static binding.
