Transient variable.. 

  A transient variable is a variable that may not be serialized.
   We use the transient keyword to indicate to the Java virtual machine 
   that the indicated variable is not part of the persistent state of the object.
   
   When we serialize an object, transient variable is not serialized.
   
Private transient Connection con = null;
