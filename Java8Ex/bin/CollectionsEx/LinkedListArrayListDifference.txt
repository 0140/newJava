
1) An ArrayList class can act as a list only.
LinkedList class can act as a list, queue(Queue interface) and stack(Deque interface.)

LinkedList class uses doubly linked list to store the elements. 
 ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.
 
 
2) Search: ArrayList search operation is pretty fast compared to
     the LinkedList search  operation.      

     Reason: ArrayList maintains index based system for its elements 
     as it uses array data structure implicitly 
     which makes it is faster for searching an element in the list.
     LinkedList implements doubly linked list 
      which requires the traversal through all the elements for searching an element.
      
      get(index) in ArrayList gives the performance of O(1) 
     while LinkedList performance is O(n).
      
3) Deletion: LinkedList element deletion is faster compared to ArrayList.
    
     LinkedList remove operation gives O(1) performance 
      while ArrayList gives variable performance: O(n) in worst case 
      (while removing first element)
       and O(1) in best case (While removing last element).
       
       Reason: LinkedList’s each element maintains two pointers (addresses) 
       which points to the both neighbor elements in the list.
        Hence removal only requires change in the pointer location 
        in the two neighbor nodes (elements) of the node which is going to be removed.
         While In ArrayList all the elements need to be shifted
          to fill out the space created by removed element.
 4)   Inserts Performance: LinkedList add method gives O(1) performance
         while ArrayList gives O(n) in worst case.
          Reason is same as Deletion Performance.
          
 5)  Memory Overhead: ArrayList maintains indexes and element data 
       while LinkedList maintains element data 
              and two pointers for prevous and next nodes. 
              So the memory consumption is high in LinkedList comparatively.






ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.	
    LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
    
Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array.
 If any element is added or removed from the array, 
     all the bits are shifted right or left in memory as per the case.
     
     Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList
      because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
