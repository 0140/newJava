

When a reference is cast into wrong type or different type,
     we get ClassCastException

HashSet hm = new HashSet();

		hm.add("One");
		hm.add(new Car());

		for (Object o : hm) {
			String s = (String) o; // Downcast . TypeCast    // ClassCastException
		}
------------------------------------

Class Loader must return the same class object reference 
          for the same class name every time Class Loader is asked for it.
  Otherwise the system will believe there are two different classes 
  with the same name and will throw a ClassCastException 
  whenever you assign an object reference between them.
