
Fail-Fast Iterators In Java :
  When a collection is being iterated by collections framework classes,
    if another thread modifies same collection,
    first thread throws ConcurrentModificationException when accessing the collection.
    This is Fail fast situation.
   Ex: HashMap is fail fast.


Fail-Fast iterators, returned by most of the collection types in collection framework,
 doesn’t tolerate any structural modifications to a collection while iterating over it.
  (Structural modifications means add, remove or updating an element in the collection) 
  They throw ConcurrentModificationException if a collection is structurally modified 
  while iteration is going on the collection. But, they don’t throw
   any exceptions if the collection is modified by the iterator’s own methods
 like remove().
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Fail Safe:
 Fail-Safe iterators don’t throw any exceptions 
 if the collection is modified while iterating over it. 
 Because, they iterate on the clone of the collection not on the actual collection. 
 
 Ex: Hashtable, Vector are fail safe.
