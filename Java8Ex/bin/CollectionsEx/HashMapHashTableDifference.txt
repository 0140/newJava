Difference between HashMap and Hashtable
HashMap and Hashtable both are used to store data in key and value form.
 Both are using hashing technique to store unique keys.

But there are many differences between HashMap and Hashtable classes that are given below.
---------------------------------------------------------
HashMap	Hashtable
1) HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe.
 Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe.
 As Hashtable is synchronized, it is slower compared to HashMap.



2) HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
	Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.
3) HashMap is a new class introduced in JDK 1.2 as part of Collections Framework.
	Hashtable is a legacy class.
	
4) HashMap is fast.	Hashtable is slow.
5) HashMap is traversed by Iterator.
	Hashtable is traversed by Enumeration and Iterator.


6) Iterator in HashMap is fail-fast.	
    Enumeration in Hashtable is not fail-fast. (fail safe)

-------------------------------------------------------
// HashMap inherits AbstractMap class.	Hashtable inherits Dictionary class.
7) We can make the HashMap as synchronized by calling this code
Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashMap);	Hashtable is internally synchronized 
and can't be unsynchronized.

Most of times I use HashMap. Because we do not need Synchronization.
But when we need synchronization,
