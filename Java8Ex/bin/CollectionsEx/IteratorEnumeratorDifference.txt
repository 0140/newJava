Enumeration and Iterator are two interfaces in java.util package 
    which are used to traverse over the elements of a Collection object.

Iterator interface is introduced from JDK 1.2 where as
      Enumeration interface is there from JDK 1.0.

But using Iterator, we can also remove an element while traversing the Collection.
       This is the one major difference between Enumeration and Iterator in java. 

       ----------------------
Fail-Fast Vs Fail-Safe

Iterator is a fail-fast  .
 i.e it throws ConcurrentModificationException if a collection is modified by other thread
 while iterating.   
 Where as Enumeration is fail-safe . 
 It doesn’t throw any exceptions if a collection is modified while iterating.
