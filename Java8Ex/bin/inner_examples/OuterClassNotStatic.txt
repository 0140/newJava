Outer class need not be static:

JVM does not instantiate a class to call main method.
It alreay behaves like static.

1)Every class is already common to all of its objects,
 and there is no need to make it static to become available to all of its objects.
 
2)  To access static members of a class, we use ClassName.member.

 An outer class is part of a package.
  We can directly access the class by   writing package_name.class_name
   (similar to class_name.static_field_name). 
So  , there is no need to do make static, that's already behaving like static by default.
