
Static Nested Class
A static inner class is a nested class
       which is a static member of the outer class. 
       It can be accessed without instantiating the outer class
           OuterClass.InnerClass
       
        Just like static members, a static nested class does not 
        have access to the instance variables and methods of the outer class. 

class MyOuter {
   static class Nested_Demo {
   }
}
----------------------------
public class Outer {
   static class Nested_Demo {
      public void show() {
         System.out.println("This is my nested class");
      }
   }
   
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Outer.Nested_Demo nested = new Outer.Nested_Demo();	 
      nested.show();
   }
}
