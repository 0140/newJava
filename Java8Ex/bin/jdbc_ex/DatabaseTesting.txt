 Did you do database testing? 
Yes.
Whenever we enter data in web pages, we save data of  the page by submitting. 
Data is saved in the database. We login into db and use SQL to verify whether 
data is saved correctly or not. Check all the relevant tables for data modifications. 
Known as data validation. . 
I used Toad for Oracle for this.
We write SQL queries for manual DB testing.

We need to write JDBC code to read data from DB for automation testing.
 Read data saved from DB using jdbc code and compare the data read with the expected data.



-------------------------------------------
Data structure testing – DB objects like tables, indexes are created or not
Data validation – data saved correctly saved in tables
Data Integrity – foreign keys not violated

Oracle,   MongoDB 
I wrote complex queries using groups, having, sub queries, joins.



-------------------
Yes
I called them
They perform backend processing
   Like claims processing.
      Find duplicate claims that are submitted.
      This is one procedure.
      This can cbe chcked on bakend
      
      Usually database specific operations we do using stored procedures..
