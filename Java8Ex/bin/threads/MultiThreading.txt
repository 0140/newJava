
Multithreading in java is a process of executing two or more threads 
     simultaneously to maximum utilization of CPU.
     
      Java Thread is a Sequence of execution. Lightweight process that executes some task.
     --------------------
     We can set different priorities to different Threads
      but it doesn’t guarantee that higher priority thread will execute 
      first than lower priority thread.
       Thread scheduler is the part of Operating System implementation 
       and when a Thread is started, 
       it’s execution is controlled by Thread Scheduler and 
       JVM doesn’t have any control on it’s execution.
