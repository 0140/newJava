1) New
The thread is in new state if you create an instance of Thread class
      but before the invocation of start() method.

2) Runnable
The thread is in runnable state after invocation of start() method, 
but the thread scheduler has not selected it to be the running thread.

3) Running
The thread is in running state if the thread scheduler has selected it for running.

4) Non-Runnable (Blocked)
This is the state when the thread is still alive, but is currently not eligible to run.
   We called Thread.sleep() or Thread scheduler blocked it.

5) Terminated
A thread is in terminated or dead state when its run() method exits.
