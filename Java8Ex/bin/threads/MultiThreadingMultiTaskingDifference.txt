1) In multitasking, several programs are executed concurrently 
e.g. Java compiler and a Java IDE like Netbeans or Eclipse, 

In multi-threading multiple threads execute either same 
         or different part of program multiple times at the same time.


2) Multi-threading is more granular than multi-tasking. 
In multi-tasking,  CPU switches between multiple programs
      to complete their execution in real time, 
      while in multi-threading CPU switches between multiple threads of the same program.
       Remember, switching between multiple processes has more context switching cost 
       than switching between multiple threads of the same program.

3) Processes are heavyweight as compared to threads,
    they require their own address space, 
    which means multi-tasking is heavy compared to multithreading.

     Inter-process communication is expensive and limited and context switching 
     from one process to another is expensive and limited.
