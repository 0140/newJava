How do you create your own immutable class?

To create immutable class in java, you have to do following steps.
1.	Declare the class as final so it can't be extended.
2.	Make all fields private so that direct access is not allowed.
3.	Don't provide setter methods for variables.
4.	Make all mutable fields final so that it's value can be assigned only once.

Immutable objects are Thread safe.


Advantages: 
Thread safety
Atomicity of failure
Absence of hidden side-effects
Protection against null reference errors
Ease of caching
Prevention of identity mutation
Avoidance of temporal coupling between methods
Support for referential transparency
Protection from instantiating logically-invalid objects
Protection from inadvertent corruption of existing objects
--------------------------------------------------------
Following are the requirements:
• Class must be declared as final (So that child classes can’t be created)
• Data members in the class must be declared as final (So that we can’t change the value of it after object creation)
• A parameterized constructor
• Getter method for all the variables in it
• No setters(To not have option to change the value of the instance variable)
