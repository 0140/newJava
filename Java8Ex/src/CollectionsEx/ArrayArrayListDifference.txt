Array vs ArrayList in Java

1)Array is a fixed length data structure 
whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class. 
We cannot change length of array once created in Java but ArrayList can be changed.
Usually, ArrayList size increases by more than 50% 
     after it is full and we try to add one more element..

(when a ArrayList is declared and initialized using default constructor, 
memory space for 10 elements will be created. 
now, when i add 11 th element, what happens is
 ArrayList create a new object with OldCapacity*3/2+1 = 10*3/2+1 =16)

2) We cannot store primitives in ArrayList, it can only store objects.
 But array can contain both primitives and objects in Java.
  Since Java 5, primitives are automatically converted in objects 
which is known as auto-boxing and saved into ArrayList.

3)ArrayList is collections framework class. So Collections API can be used with ArrayList.
    These API not available with Array.
    
4) We can use Iterator to loop on ArrayList. Not on Array.
   Iterator returned by ArrayList is fail fast. (ConcurrentModificationException)
   
5) We can ensure type safety using ArraList Generics class.

6)  Multi-dimensional :  Array can be multi dimensional , 
while ArrayList is always single dimensional.

Integer addarrayobject[][] = new Integer[3][2];
addarrayobject[0][0]= new Integer(8);  

ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> al = null;
