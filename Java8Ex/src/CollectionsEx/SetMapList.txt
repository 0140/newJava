Collections are used to process multiple objects together.
Collections framework has provided API to make the processing uniform.
 
Set   (Collection of Unordered, Unique elements)
  Set interface is an unordered collection  and  it won’t allow duplicate elements .
  But it allows null elements  ie.. we can add null elements to Set implementations.
  We cannot get elements  by  key or index .  
List
  List interface is a ordered collection and it allows duplicate , null elements .
  We can get elements by index in List . Set has no Index.
   Index is added in the same order in which elements are added.
   Like Set , List also a not synchronized collection .
   
   List size is dynamic. But array size is fixed.

Map
  Map is a collection of  key, value pairs.
 Key is Unique
  Value can be duplicated.
  It allows one null key, multiple null values.

Map interface is a unordered collection ,
             it allows duplicate values but not duplicate keys .
             
      HashMap is unordered. Not sorted.
       TreeMap is sorted on Key. IN both, key is unique.
       I saved types of insurance in Insurance Map..
  -----------------------------
I Used ArrayList, HashMap, TreeMap, HashSet.
    LinkedList..
     
 We can use LinkedLsit to traverse. 
 I use Iterator to loop through.
 Yes. We can delete member of collection. Iterator can delete member.
 
List<WebElement> linksOnPage = driver.findElements(By.tagName("a"));
