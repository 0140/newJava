
 When to Use a Linked List?

 		We need to do constant insertions and deletions.
        LinkedList gives better performance with insertions and deletions.
       
       We don’t need random access to any specific elements.
       Random Access is slow with LinkedList.
       Search (get method) operations are fast in Arraylist 
       
      -------------------------- 
         
        When to use LinkedList and when to use ArrayList?
1)  the insert and remove operations give good performance (O(1)) 
in LinkedList compared to ArrayList(O(n)). 
Hence if there is a requirement of frequent addition and deletion in application 
then LinkedList is a best choice.

2) Search (get method) operations are fast in Arraylist (O(1))
 but not in LinkedList (O(n)) 
 so If there are less add and remove operations and more search operations requirement,
  ArrayList would be your best bet.
