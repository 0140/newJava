How does it work?

HashMap works on the principle of hashing, we have put(key, value) 
and get(key) method for storing and retrieving Objects from HashMap. 
 		 * hashCode is calculated for key.
		 * That points to address in memory bucket where the key value pairs saved. 
		   When hashcode is used, Saving and Retrieves faster.
		  
  So. For HashMap key object, we implement equals and hashCode method
  					so that the object will be a fit for HashMap key.
		
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we pass Key and Value object  to put() method on Java HashMap, 
HashMap implementation calls hashCode method on Key object 
and applies returned hashcode  
 to find a bucket location for storing Entry object, 
 important point to remember is that HashMap in Java stores both key and value object
  as Map.Entry in a bucket which is essential to understand the retrieving logic. 


How do we retreve from HashMap?
First calculate hashCode for key.
hashCode of key is used to identify the bucket in which the  key value pair is saved.
 after finding bucket location, we will call keys.equals() method to identify
  a correct node in internal LinkedList and return associated value object for that key 
  in Java HashMap.
