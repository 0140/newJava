Finally:  

Finally is a block of code part of try catch finally.
Finally block of code always runs whether
 try block runs without exceptions or try block gives exception.
 
Finally is used to close resources like Database Connections or File Pointers..
If resources are not closed, they will be left in memory leading to OutOfMemoryError.
Ex: Files left in memory. Not enough memory to hold many file.
-----------------------------------
If you use System.exit(..) finally will be running>?
 No. If you do System.exit, finally block will not run.
---------------------------------------------
if I give return statement in a try block, does finally run?

   Yes. When a method is going to execute return statement, 
   first finally block runs and then only the method will return.
   
--Can I use finally block without catch blocks?
    Yes. I can use without catch block. We need try block minimum.
    We want to close resources even if exceptions are not handled.
   ---------------------------------------------------
   NO. One catch or finally needed for try block..
