

Errors  signal the end of   application as we know it. 
It typically cannot be recovered from and should cause JVM to exit. 
Errors are not caught except to possibly log
 or display and appropriate message before exiting.

Example: OutOfMemoryError - Not much   can be done as  program can no longer run.

             he most applications should crash rather than try to handle the errors.
