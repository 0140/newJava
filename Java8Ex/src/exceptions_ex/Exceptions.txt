 	What is exception?
 	 Exceptions are abnormal conditions.
  When exceptions occur, normal flow of program is disturbed.
   It would halt execution of program and would throw exception 
    unless we handle exception. 
    Ex: We are trying to read a file and the file is not there. 
        This causes FileNotFoundException
 ----------------------------   
	Why exception to be handled?   
 
 * If we do not handle exceptions, normal or required flow of the
 * 		application will break  when the exception occurs.
 * 		Even when exception occurs, business logic defines how the 
 * 		system needs to behave. Ex: If input file is not there,
 * 		production support team should get an email 		
 *      with the necessary information.
 *      We need to handle exceptions like this,
 *       to maintain application logic or the business logic.
 
 // Runtime means we need not

 How do we handle exceptions:
 
  Two ways to handle exceptions..
            Try catch blocks or method can throw exceptions.
 
 Try catch blocks used to handle exceptions
 		when exception occurs, control goes to exception handler..
        and the code in exception handler is executed..
        Program execution continiues after try catch block..
        
 Second way to handle exceptions:
       we can throw exceptions in the signature of the method.
      public boolean checkAge(int age) throws NotAllowedToSwimException
