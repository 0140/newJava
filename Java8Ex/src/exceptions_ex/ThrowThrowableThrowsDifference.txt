103)	Difference between throw, throws, Throwable

Throw is used to throw exceptions when application logic itself needs to throw exception .
  ex: throw new DiscountException(); They do not want to give discount to some customers.
  
Throws: part of the   method signature and is used to declare 
     that the method can throw these exceptions
     ex: public static void process(int i)  throws FileNotFoundException, IOException   
                the method can throw the exceptions.  
	
Throwable:  Throwable is the super class of all exceptions in Java.

When:
throw is used when we want to stop execution flow. 
Like when dicount is not given DiscountExcdeption stops flow.

Throws is for propagation. Suppose I get FileNotFoundException. 
We log the mesage there. Then rethrow company level exception like AnthemException
that propagates to the controller.
Controller can perform business logic for example, send ...

public void calculatePrice() throws DiscountException, IOException {
    if (newCustomer)
    	throw new DiscountException(); // we dont give discount to new customers
 
 }
