
How do we handle exceptions:
 
  Two ways to handle exceptions..
            Try catch blocks or method can throw exceptions.
 
 Try catch blocks used to handle exceptions
 		when exception occurs, control goes to exception handler..
        and the code in exception handler is executed..
        Program execution continiues after try catch block..
        
 Second way to handle exceptions:
       we can throw exceptions in the signature of the method.
      public boolean checkAge(int age) throws NotAllowedToSwimException
