There are two ways to handle exceptions in Java.

We can implement try catch blocks to handle exceptions
       or we can throw the exceptions in method definition using throws clause.
       
 Using Try catch blocks:
 Try catch blocks surround  the code where exceptions can happen.
We can have multiple catch blocks also.
 Based on the exception, corresponding catch block will run.
We handle specific exceptions first in try catch block.

Using throws clause in method definition: 
    A throws clause in method definition declares that the method can give exceptions.
       If we use throws clause,
        the caller of the method has to handle the exceptions.
