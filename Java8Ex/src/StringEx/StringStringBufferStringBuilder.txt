
What is the difference between String, StringBufffer, StringBuilder?

String is Immutable.. StringBuffer, StringBuilder are mutable..
STring modification will create new string objects. This a slow operation.

When we are manipulating a string, we need to use StringBufffer or 
StringBuilder for faster operations.
So StringBuffer and String Builder are faster compared to String. 
 
-------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Both are mutable.

StringBuffer is synchronized. StringBuilder is not synchronized.String is not synchronized
Therefore StringBuffer is slower compared to StringBuilder.

 StringBuilder is not synchronized. Therefore faster compared to StringBuffer..
 So, most of the situations, we use StringBuilderâ€¦   where multi threading is not a concern.

StringBuffer sbuffer = new StringBuffer(); //Mutable //  Synchronized // slower
		sbuffer.append("a")
			.append("b")
			.append("c")
			.append("d")
			.append("gh");
		System.out.println("sbuffer:" +sbuffer);
		
		
		StringBuilder sbuilder = new StringBuilder(); //Mutable --  Not Synchronized //Performs better -- faster
		sbuilder.append("p")
			.append("q")
			.append("r")
			.append("s");
		System.out.println("sbuilder:" +sbuilder);
