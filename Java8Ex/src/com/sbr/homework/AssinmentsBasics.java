	 * 1)
	 * If a number is divisible by 3 print Fizz
	 * If a number is divisible by 5 print Buzz
	 * If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print Fizz Buzz
	 * 
	 * 2) Two numbers a = 4; b = 7;
	 * 		Exchange the values. Don't use third variable.
	 * 
	 * 2.1) Declare an array of 7 elements. 
	 *     Find out the sum of the array elements.
	 *     
	 *     
	 * 
	 * 3) a = 10;
	 *    What is:  System.out.println(a++ + ++a);
	 *    //    a= a++ + a++;
	 *    // a-- - a--

	 *    
	 * 4) System.out.println( 3 + 3 + 3);
	 *    System.out.println("3" + 3 + 3);
	 * 	  System.out.println( 3 + 3 + "3");
	 *    System.out.println( 1  + "2" + 3 + 4);
	 *    
	 *    Why are they printed different?
	 *    
	 *    
	 * 5) Calculate Factorial of a Given number.
	 * 				Clue: Recursion
	 * 
	 * 6) Read a number from command line. 
	 *    Calculate factorial of the number given.
	 *    
	 * 7) Evaluate
	 *   a = 10, b = 10;
	 *   
	 *   if(++a>2||++b>2){
            a++;
           }
	 * 
	 *    System.out.println(a + "  " + b);
	 *    
	 *   8) instanceof
	 *   
	 *   9) Create a Java bean for Person. name, age, admitted.
	 *      Getters setters need to be there. Call the bean from  another client class.
	 *      Populate the bean and read the values from the bean.
	 *      
	 *   10) Car secondcar  = null;
			   
			if ( secondcar != null &  secondcar.getOwnerName().equals("Suresh"))
			{
				System.out.println("Car owner Suresh");
			}
			
			Fix NullPointerException.

		      System.out.println(1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5);
		      
		12) Read a value from command line and print
	 *        *
	 *        **
	 *        ***
	 *        ****
	 *        (Print so many rows. Each row should have stars as amany as the row number)

	 * 13) 	 * BMW class is sub class of Car.
		 * 
		 * Car c = new BMW();
		 * BMW b = new Car();
		 * Which line is wring?
		 * 
	 * 14)  How do you force a method override -- 
	 * 		Solution: an abstract class method
	 * 
	 * 15) Write example code for object oriented features from your project?
	 * 
	 * 16) Write Singleton code. Ex: Property file reading
	 * 
	 * 17) Write code to print prime numbers upto 100
	 * 
	 * 18) Count
	 *    No of 6s upto a given number
	 *    
	 *    
	 *    
	 *    --If number has 6 and divisible by 3, then print it.
	 *    --6_DivisionAlgorithm.java
	 *    
	 * 19) Write a sub class in a different package compared to super class.
	 *  Make sure protected member from super can be used in sub class 
	 *  also even if it is different package.


	 * 20) Declare a array of numbers. Initialize the array.
	 *   Print the elements of the array except the fourth element.
	 *
