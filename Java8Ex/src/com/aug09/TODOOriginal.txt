Assignment: Read a number from command line. Calculate factorial of that number.

passing arguments to java class

Assignment: Given an array of numbers.. Write a loop to print the contents of the array.
   Do not print the numbers if the number is more than 99.
      Clue: Use a continue statement.
      
Write a simple method and call it.
