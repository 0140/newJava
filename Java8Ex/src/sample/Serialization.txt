Serialization   gives us byte stream of the object.  
We can transfer the bytes on wire.. to another JVM or machine.
If we want to save object in hard disk, then also we can serialize and save.

Deserialization is the reverse of Seralization. 
    That means Deserialization converts byte data read from data source into object.


FileOutputStream fout=new FileOutputStream("f.txt");  
  ObjectOutputStream out=new ObjectOutputStream(fout);  
  
  out.writeObject(objectReference);  

  benefits: We can transfer objects on network. we convert into bytestream and transfer.
