In java, garbage means unreferenced objects.

Garbage Collection is process of automatically reclaiming 
the unused runtime memory used by resources or objects . 
 Unused objects are those that are not referred by any reference variable.

Garbage collection is performed by a daemon thread called Garbage Collector(GC). 
This thread calls the finalize() method before object is garbage collected.

Garbage Collector starts automatically. JVM manages garbage collector.
------------------------------------------------------------

An object be unreferenced:
By nulling the reference
By assigning a reference to another object.

Car c = new Car();
 c= null;
 c= new Car():
------------------------------------------------------------
The finalize() method is invoked each time before the object is garbage collected. 
This method can be used to perform cleanup processing. 
This method is defined in Object class as:

protected void finalize(){}  

Finalize method needs to be overridden.

Garbage collection is performed by a daemon thread called Garbage Collector(GC). 
This thread calls the finalize() method before object is garbage collected.

It starts automatically. JVM manages garbage collector.

------------------------------------------------------------
Can we force garbage collection?
No.
System.gc();
We can ask JVM to start garbage collection using System.gc();. Still no guarantee that
it runs immediately.

Runtime.??
