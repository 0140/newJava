
 1. we have 2 variables:
     int a = 3;
     int b = 8;
     exchange the values in a and b without using third variable
     
 2. write a  program to find factorial for any given number
 
 3. Write a program to find nth element in fibonacci series.
 
 4.  We have a number i.
    When i is divisible by 3 only, then print "Fizz"
    When i  is divisible by 5 only, then print "Buzz"
    When i  is divisible by 5 and 3, then print "FizzBuzz"
    
 5. Print for a given row number:
     *
     **
     ***
     ****
     *****
     
 6. read a value from command line and print
 
 7. What is result of:
    int i = 10
    System.out.println(i++ + ++i);
    
 8. What is NullPointerException and when it comes?
 
 9. What is the difference between == and equals method
 
 10. What is printed?
 
    System.out.println("1" + 2);
    System.out.println("1" + 2 + 3);
    System.out.println( 1  + 2 + "3");
    System.out.println( 1  + "2" + 3 + 4);
    
 11. What is printed and why is it printed so?   
   Pass by value or pass by ref in java?
 
 public class PassByValueExample {
	
	
	public int process(int n)
	{
		n = n+2;
		return n;
	}
	
	public void process(City c)
	{
		 c.setName("Atlanta");
		 //process(4);
		 
		 
	}
	

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		
		 System.out.println("webdriver.chrome.driver");
		 
		 
		 int loc = 10;
		 PassByValueExample p = new PassByValueExample();
		 int x = p.process(loc); // Pass by value
		 
		 System.out.println("loc:" + loc);
		 
		 City c1 = new City();
		 c1.setName("Princeton");
		 p.process(c1);
		 System.out.println(c1.getName()); 
    }
}
 
12. Count the number of 2s upto 25. 
	Count every number 2 from 0 upto 25 whenever number 2 appears.
		Ex: 1..12. Count is 2. (2 and 12 have)  -- code in Count2s.java
