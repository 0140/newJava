 Runtime polymorphism means the method that will be invoked is decided at runtime .
 this is implemented via overriding. 
 
 we can have a method in the subclass that will have same method name 
 and same parameters. we can invoke the same  method name
  using the reference variable. 
  
  we know in Java the reference variable can refer to an object of same type
   or sub class type object
    
   now if we are calling overridden method using the reference variable which method 
   should run? either the method from the superclass or the method from the subclass ?
   
   this is decided at runtime only based on  the object being referred. 
             --this is known as runtime polymorphism.
             Also known as Dynamic binding.
            
            Ex: CreditCard.validate method
               Visa extends CreditCard
               Amex extends CreditCard
               
               Which method called? Visa.CreditCard or Amex.CreditCard? Decided at runtime.
