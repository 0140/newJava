Autoboxing is a process by which primitive type 
  is automatically encapsulated(boxed) into its equivalent type wrapper
  
     HashMap<Integer, Double> hashmap = .....
     hashmap.put(new Integer(3), new Double(34.5)); // we are saving wrapper objects here
	    
	    hashmap.put(9, 356.7); // Auto boxing -- primitive to object
	  ------------------------------------
Auto-Unboxing is a process by which the value of an object
       is automatically extracted from a type Wrapper class into promitive.
       
       	    double d2= hashmap.get(9); // Autounboxing   -- Object to primitive
