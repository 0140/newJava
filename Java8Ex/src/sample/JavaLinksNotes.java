	/**
	 * 	JVM: The Java Virtual machine (JVM) is the virtual machine that 
	 * run the Java bytecodes. The JVM doesn't understand Java source code,
	 *  that's why you compile your *.java files to obtain *.class files 
	 *  that contain the bytecodes understandable by the JVM. 
	 *  It's also the entity that allows Java to be a "portable language" 
	 *  (write once, run anywhere). Indeed there are specific implementations
	 *   of the JVM for different systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS, see the 
	 *   wikipedia list..), the aim is that with the same bytecodes they all 
	 *   give the same results.
	 *   
	 *   JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment.
	 *   It is used to provide runtime environment.It is the implementation 
	 *   of JVM.It physically exists.
	 *   It contains set of libraries (rt.jar) + other files that JVM uses 
	 *   at runtime.
	 *   i.e. JRE = JVM + Java Packages Classes(like util, math, lang, 
	 *   awt,swing etc)+runtime libraries.
	 *   
	 *   
	 *   Java Runtime Environment (JRE):
	 *   The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, 
	 *   the Java Virtual Machine, 
	 *   and other components to run applets and applications written in the 
	 *   Java programming language. 
	 *   
	 *   In addition, two key deployment technologies are part of the JRE:
	 *    
	 *   Java Plug-in, which enables applets to run in popular browsers; 
	 *   
	 *   and Java Web Start, 
	 *   which deploys standalone applications over a network.
	 *   
	 *   
	 *   
	 *   
	 *   Java Developer Kit contains tools needed to develop the Java programs,
	 *    and also the JRE to run the programs. 
	 *    The tools include compiler (javac.exe), Java application launcher
	 *     (java.exe), Appletviewer, etc…
	 *     
	 *     You need JDK, if at all you want to write your own programs, 
	 *     and to compile them. For running java programs, 
	 *     JRE is sufficient.
