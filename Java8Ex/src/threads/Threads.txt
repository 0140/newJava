Thread is a sequence of execution.
Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing.

Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.


Threads are independent,
 if    exception occurs in one thread, 
it doesn't affect other threads. Threads share  a common memory area.
